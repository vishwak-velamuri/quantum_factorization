This is the submission for the Quantum Rings Challenge from the group QRing Minds. This will be submitted to the MIT IquHACK Quantum Computing Hackathon.

Problem:
The problem that we needed to solve was to figure out the code to factor semiprime integers. That is, when given a number N with two prime factors, we need to find those two prime factors.

Implementation:
In order to use Quantum Computing to acheive this, we will use Shor's algorithm to solve for the factors.
